    <p><strong> This ultimate burger recipe is simple and deluxe – you'll never make a homemade burger the same way again! Well-seasoned, high quality beef, fresh, crisp toppings and a cracking special sauce will outshine any fast food version. </strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>225g-250g beef mince, 15% fat</li>
        <li>1 level tsp salt   </li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 brioche burger bun (cut side toasted)</li>
       
    </ul>

    <h2>For the burger sauce</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 gherkin, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp freshly chopped dill</li>

    </ul>


    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

    <ol>

        <li>Tip the mince into a large bowl and break up with a fork. Add the salt and massage with your hands until the mixture is soft and the salt is well incorporated. Cover and leave to stand at room temperature for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, mix all the ingredients together.  Set aside</li>
        <li>Divide the mince mixture into two equal portions and pat into two thin burgers approximately 12cm/4½in diameter. Use a small bowl or saucer as a guide if you want them to be really neat.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Add the burgers and cook for a minute on each side or until browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve the burgers and sauce in the toasted bun with the toppings of your choice. </li>

    </ol>
